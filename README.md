# 📝 Notes + To-Do List (React.js)

A simple **Notes + To-Do List App** built with React.js.  
This is an upgrade to my earlier [To-Do List project](https://github.com/jaleel1122/simple-ToDo-list), where I added the ability to **create and manage notes** alongside tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Add and delete **To-Do tasks**
- 📝 Create and manage **Notes**
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- 💾 Data persistence using **localStorage**
- 🎨 Simple, clean UI

---

## 🎯 What I Practiced
- Reusing **components** for different features
- Managing **state** for multiple entities (notes & todos)
- Handling user input and form submission
- Thinking in React: breaking UI into smaller pieces

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements
- Edit notes and tasks
- Add categories/tags
- Better styling with Tailwind or CSS frameworks

This is a **practice project** while learning React.
